	<p>This application was developed as a joint project between Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering at West Virginia University's College of Engineering and Mineral Resources.  The computer science team (above, "authors") is derived from the Fall 2012 HCI: Interaction Design and Programming class.  This team chose to work with the Mechanical Engineering Human Powered Vehicle group in preparation for their 2nd appearance in the ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) Human Powered Vehicle Competition.</p>
	<p>The team will compete in the Eastern Division in April 2013 using a recumbent trike they designed and built during 2012 - 2013 academic year.</p>
	<p>The HCI team is delighted to take part in this effort and to participate in the national competition, with hopes of gaining attention in the "innovation" scores for this custom built application. The application's unique properties are shown in data sharing across the network between the rider and the ground team.</p>
	<p>Future development will include incorporation of GPS data, VOIP communication and further user customization along with a companion tablet application to view live race data.</p>
